This was our first try to make a revolutionary app for MTG community. It was a lot of learning and fun, indeed we found some interesting things in another framework for hybrid development. We'll start again using React-Native and some other cool stuffs.
Our main objective is provide a human app to help MTG lovers to trade, manage and sell cards for free!
Please feel free to help us to achieve this, we'll enjoy your suggestions!
